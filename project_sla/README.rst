The Project SLA module is a feature of Odoo that allows defining Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for opportunities (tasks) generated by the Project module. The feature offers the possibility to configure multiple priority levels and set up rules for each of them. Rules can be configured based on different fields, such as project, partner, tags and task priority.

Usage
=====

To start using the Project SLA module, it is necessary to configure the projects to use SLAs and define a calendar for the rules to be applied. Once the project is configured, the user can create a new SLA by navigating to the "Project" application and selecting "SLAs" from the configuration menu. From there, the user can create a new SLA and configure the rules based on the fields mentioned above.

After creating the SLAs, create a new task and wait for the scheduled action responsible for synchronizing the SLA lines to be executed or force its execution through the technical menu where the scheduled actions are located.
